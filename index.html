    <!-- Guess what letter I'm thinking of 

Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).

<!-- PSUEDO_CODE 
1.I would have to create an event listener to capture the user key input. 
2. Then i would have to store that key input and compare it to the an array of letters representing the alphabet 
3. I would have to create a variable that represents the cumputer guess, that variable would be assigned to a randomly generated number that represents the index of the alphabet array.
4.Then i would have a for loop that would run continuously comparing the user input key value to the "computer guess" variable.
5.then i would have to create variables to represent the values of : Wins, loses,guesses left.
6.Iin the for loop would have to increase the number of wins if the, loses
7. I would also have display the array of letters that the user has already input.
